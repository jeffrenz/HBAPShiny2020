# COVID-19 Tracking App: An HBAP Coronal Project

The Covid-19 dashboard displays confirmed virus cases on a map with the ability to click on the county to view totals, a sortable data grid, and an interactive trend plot that allows users to pick how many days to go back in time.

## HBAP COVID-19 Shiny Dashboard Overview

The Dashboard is updated daily show global and the selected county totals pulling data from an Azure SQL Server. The Dashboard map allows users to drill down/up to view virus totals and allows users to click the bubbles which represent counties to view virus cases and deaths. It has a trend plot which changes the number of bars as the use changes the input value with the slider.
There is a sortable data grid that provides totals by state. The dashboard also shows related information from other sites such as pdfs, videos, and interactive maps.
